# BoostNow
Open Source E-commerce Project:

BoostNow is based on yii Framework. A complete E-commerce project currently is in development. I have created admin panel for the BoostNow using AdminLTE. Added some basic features. If you know how to setup on your web server you can do yourself. Otherwise you can ask for help. Soon I will write the instruction to setup the whole project. Once it's ready for production mode.
